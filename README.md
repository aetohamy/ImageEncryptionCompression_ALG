# ImageEncryptionCompression_ALG
## Design & Analysis Of Algorithms Course Project 17'
### A tool for image encryption using Linear Feedback Shift Register method and compression using huffman coding using a greedy algorithm and a priority queue.

**Main Features**
- Image Encryption using an initial seed and a tap position
- Image Encryption using an Alphanumeric passwrod with a tap position
- Image Compression saving it as a ".tdas" extension.
- Image Decompression from any .tdas file extension with the proper format.
- MetroUI and the ability to see the file's compression ratio , size before and after compression and color frequencies of the image as well as the 3 Huffman Trees.
